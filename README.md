### What is the project ? <a name="projet"></a>

Using examples, this project is just a quick reminder of the main SQL commands you need to know to work effectively in the data professions.
The SQL queries are made with DuckDB and written in a Jupyter Notebook.
The databases used are fictitious.


### Installation <a name="install"></a>

To explore this project download the databases from Git.

All dependencies to install are listed in requirements.txt file. 


### Files Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

 * client.csv : all the information of each client. 

 * invoice.csv : The detail of the invoices issued to clients. 

 * item.csv : The items list.

 * PhilippeBookPredVersion6-1.ipynb : 
        This notebook conducts data analysis tasks such as data processing, cleaning, and exploratory analysis, accompanied by the creation of illustrative plots. It proceeds with feature selection through engineering and pruning, offering clear justifications for the chosen features. The subsequent steps involve model training, elucidating the reasoning behind the chosen model while also comparing different model variations. Ultimately, comprehensive evaluations are executed using suitable metrics, with a subsequent interpretation of results to facilitate well-informed decisions.

### Authors & Motivations <a name="authors"></a>

This project was carried out as part of the preparation for an MSC in Data Science and Data Engineering at the DSTI.

The members of the project group are :
 - Philippe FOGOUM - Data engineering
 - Sa√Ød HAMDI - Data science
 - David BEGARIN - Data science
 - Guillaume NONY - Data science

### How to run the project : 
Open PhilippeBookPredVersion6-1.ipynb  in your favorite IDE, or better still on github, following whet you will see the button, Open in collab, on which you can click to launch the project.
The Project goes from top to bottom on collab, the top being the initial stages of the project.
Google collab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.

### The other .ipynb files of the repository noted from PhilippeBookPredVersion1.ipynb to PhilippeBookPredVersion6.ipynb shows the advances made at each stage of our work.
